      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>MindMend consolidates key mental health resources—therapy, peer support, medication—into a single intuitive platform for underserved users.</p>

      <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <h3>User Research</h3>
<p>To inform the development of MindMend, we conducted exploratory research using three key approaches:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Public Health Reports & Research Studies:</strong> We reviewed studies on mental health service usage to better understand barriers related to affordability, insurance status, and geographic availability. These insights highlighted disparities that shaped our platform’s focus on accessible care.</li>
  <li><strong>Online Forum Analysis:</strong> We analyzed common frustrations shared on social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram. Recurring themes included difficulty finding affordable therapy, confusing website interfaces, and lack of immediate crisis support—all of which guided core features in our design.</li>
  <li><strong>Competitor Analysis:</strong> We evaluated existing mental health platforms such as BetterHelp and Talkspace. This helped us identify usability strengths (e.g., onboarding flow) and weaknesses (e.g., limited transparent pricing), which we addressed through simplified navigation and cost transparency in MindMend.</li>
</ul>

    <section id="reflection">
      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <p>Throughout the development of MindMend, we gained valuable insights into the challenges of designing for a vulnerable and underserved population. Our research and iterative design process reaffirmed the importance of prioritizing usability, accessibility, and emotional sensitivity when working on mental health-focused solutions.</p>

      <p>One of the most successful aspects of the project was our emphasis on simplifying access to mental health services. By integrating features like map-based provider searches, one-tap immediate help, and transparent medication cost comparisons, we were able to reduce the steps users need to take to get help—especially those with limited time, money, or technical literacy.</p>
    
      <p>Usability testing and heuristic evaluations were instrumental in refining our design. We identified and resolved issues such as unclear navigation, insufficient feedback after actions, and inconsistent terminology. These changes significantly improved the user experience and helped us ensure that the interface met the needs of our target users.</p>
    
      <p>If given more time, we would conduct broader usability testing with a diverse range of users to further validate our design assumptions. We would also consider adding language support and accessibility features such as screen reader compatibility and high-contrast modes.</p>
    
      <p>Overall, this project demonstrated how thoughtful design and research can bridge the gap between users and the services they need. MindMend reflects our commitment to using technology in a way that promotes equity, dignity, and mental wellness.</p>
